## **_Welcome!_**

Welcome to my custom admin dashboard. I wanted to create an example of what a dashboard would look like on a site where sales would be made. Such as a dropshipper or reseller would see when handling their products.

## **_Features_**

I plan on featuring a number of navigations that will be used, such as profile, settings, log out and log in. It will be interactive, such as hovering over certain blocks and having them react a certain way (ie. glowing, outlined, bg changed, etc.) It will also be able to be easily visbile on both ios and standard displays.

## **_Screenshots_**

I havent added any screenshots yet, I'm still thinking of ideas.
